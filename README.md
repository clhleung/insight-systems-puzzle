## Background regarding the tools involved in this challenge

I previously had some experience working with Docker and Python Flask as part of my coursework in University of California, Santa Cruz.
The only new things I had to learn about were the Docker-compose function, a bit of the PostGres SQL stuff, and the Nginx, for its
web server and reverse address proxying abilities.
